Broadly, my research aims to understand the variation in children's early language environments, and its effects on children's language abilities. Below are a few key research areas and some representative projects.

## characterising early language experience

What kinds of language inputs do children receive? How do they vary within and across children? I am interested in collecting naturalistic data from young children and analysing the distributions of such data.

- What are the actual <strong>audiovisual experiences</strong> of young children? How can we quantify and qualify their input "in the wild"?

## early word learning across linguistic environments

What are the cross-linguistic patterns in word learning? How are early vocabularies shaped by experiences of multilingualism? I use statistical modelling to understand word- and child-level predictors of word learning.

- How do the different languages heard by a <strong>bilingual</strong> child affect their language learning?

## machine learning models as cognitive models

The process of language learning is difficult to model, but recent advances in machine learning have given rise to a potential approach requiring few inductive biases. Can we use machine learning models as plausible models of language learning and language use?

- How do we <strong>evaluate the closeness</strong> of a language models to the process of human language development?

## open science, meta-science, and big team science

I believe that science is best advanced through information sharing and collaboration, and have worked on several open data repositories and large-scale collaborative endeavours.

- How do we aggregate data from various contributors into a centralised <strong>open data repository</strong>?
  - <a href="https://wordbank.stanford.edu">Wordbank</a>, a repository of child vocabulary data from Communicative Development Inventories.
  - <a href="https://peekbank.stanford.edu">Peekbank</a>, a repository of child language processing data from looking-while-listening studies.
  - <a href="https://refbank.github.io">Refbank</a>, a respository of iterated reference game data.

- How do we leverage <strong>big team science</strong> to work on large-scale distributed projects?
  - <a href="https://manybabies.org/">ManyBabies</a>, a consortium of multi-lab replication efforts for key developmental science findings.
  - The <a href="https://forrt.org/apps/fred_explorer.html">Replication Database</a>, a community crowdsourced database for replication studies.
