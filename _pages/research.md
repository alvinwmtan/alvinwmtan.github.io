Broadly, my research aims to understand the variation in children's early language environments, and its effects on children's language abilities. Below are a few key research areas and some representative projects.

## Characterising early language experience
What kinds of language inputs do children receive? How do they vary within and across children? I am interested in collecting naturalistic data from young children and analysing the distributions of such data.

- What are the actual <strong>audiovisual experiences</strong> of young children? How can we quantify and qualify their input ``in the wild''?
    - Long<sup>*</sup>, Xiang<sup>*</sup>, Stojanov<sup>*</sup>, Sparks, Yin, Keene, <ins>Tan</ins>, Feng, Zhuang, Marchman, Yamins, & Frank (2024). ``The BabyView dataset: High-resolution egocentric videos of infants' and young children's everyday experiences.'' <em>arXiv preprint.</em> <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2406.10447">[paper]</a>

- <strong>Shared book reading</strong> is a particularly rich source of children's language input. How do children's books differ from child-directed speech?
    - Dawson, Hsiao, <ins>Tan</ins>, Banerji, & Nation (2021). ``Features of lexical richness in childrenâ€™s books: Comparisons with child-directed speech.'' <em>Language Development Research.</em> <a href="https://doi.org/10.34842/5WE1-YK94">[paper]</a>
    - <ins>Tan</ins>, Read, Gamboa, Bang, & Marchman (in prep.). ``The power of the page: Comparing richness in text and talk during book sharing with two-year old children.''

## Early word learning across linguistic environments
What are the cross-linguistic patterns in word learning? How are early vocabularies shaped by experiences of bi- or multilingualism? I use statistical modelling to understand word- and child-level predictors of word learning.

- How do the different languages heard by a <strong>bilingual</strong> child affect their language learning? 
    - <ins>Tan</ins>, Marchman, & Frank (2024). ``The role of translation equivalents in bilingual word learning.'' <em>Developmental Science.</em> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/desc.13476">[paper]</a>
    - <ins>Tan</ins> & Frank (2024). ``Syntactic category bias in early bilingual vocabularies.'' <em>Bay Area Developmental Symposium.</em> <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15DnNuemS27dvTNQzBhLiF5Gb4C8PPGs7M-Tmzt7DF_I/edit?usp=sharing">[slides]</a>
    - <ins>Tan</ins>, Kachergis, Marchman, Frank, Mayor, et al. (in progress). ``Exploring the relationship between language exposure and vocabulary in bilingual children.''
- What does word learning look like <strong>cross-linguistically</strong>? What are the consistencies and variations in early vocabulary across languages?
    - <ins>Tan<sup>*</sup></ins>, Loukatou<sup>*</sup>, Braginsky, Mankewitz, & Frank (2024). ``Predicting ages of acquisition for children's early vocabulary across 27 languages and dialects.'' <em>CogSci Proceedings.</em> <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3s69v6kt">[paper]</a>

## Machine learning models as cognitive models
The process of language learning is difficult to model, but recent advances in machine learning have given rise to a potential approach requiring few inductive biases. Can we use machine learning models as plausible models of language learning in young children?

- How do we <strong>evaluate the closeness</strong> of a vision--language model to the process of human language development?
    - <ins>Tan</ins>, Yu, Long, Ma, Murray, Silverman, Yeatman, & Frank (2024). ``DevBench: A multimodal developmental benchmark for language learning.'' <em>NeurIPS Proceedings.</em> <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2406.10215">[paper]</a>
- Can we train vision--language models on <strong>naturalistic developmental training</strong> data? 
    - <ins>Tan</ins>, Hu, Long, & Frank (in progress). ``Training vision--language models from the child's perspective.''

## Open science and big team science
I believe that science is best advanced through information sharing and collaboration, and have worked on several open data repositories and large-scale collaborative endeavours.

- What does it look like to aggregate data from various contributors into a centralised <strong>open data repository</strong>?
    - <a href="https://wordbank.stanford.edu">Wordbank</a>, a repository of child vocabulary data from Communicative Development Inventories.
    - <a href="https://peekbank.stanford.edu">Peekbank</a>, a repository of child language processing data from looking-while-listening studies.
- How do we leverage <strong>big team science</strong> to work on large-scale distributed projects?
    - <a href="https://manybabies.org/">ManyBabies</a>, a consortium of multi-lab replication efforts for key developmental science findings.
    - The <a href="https://forrt.org/apps/fred_explorer.html">Replication Database</a>, a community crowdsourced database for replication studies.
